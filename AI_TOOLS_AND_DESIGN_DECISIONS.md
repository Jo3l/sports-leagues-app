# AI Tools and Design Decisions

## AI Tools Used

### Claude AI Assistant

- **How it helped**: Used for code scaffolding, component architecture design, and implementation guidance
- **Specific areas**:
  - Generated the complete Vue 3 + Vuex + TypeScript project structure
  - Designed the API service with caching mechanism
  - Implemented responsive UI using Tailwind CSS

### IDE Code Completion

- **How it helped**: TypeScript IntelliSense for better type safety and development experience
- **Specific areas**: Auto-completion for Vue 3 APIs, Vuex store typing, and component props

## Design Decisions

### Technology Stack

- **Vue 3 + Composition API**: Chosen for modern Vue development with better TypeScript support
- **Vuex 4**: Selected for centralized state management as required by the assignment
- **Axios**: Used for HTTP requests with better error handling than fetch API
- **Tailwind CSS**: Chosen for rapid UI development and consistent design system
- **TypeScript**: Added for better type safety and developer experience

### Architecture Decisions

#### Component-Based Architecture

- **LeagueCard**: Reusable component for individual league display
- **SearchBar**: Dedicated component for search functionality with clear button
- **SportFilter**: Dropdown component for sport filtering
- **SeasonBadge**: Modal component for displaying season badges
- **LeagueList**: Main container component orchestrating all functionality

#### State Management

- **Centralized Store**: All API data, filters, and UI state managed in Vuex store
- **Computed Properties**: Used for reactive data binding between components and store
- **Actions**: Async operations for API calls and complex state updates
- **Getters**: Derived state for filtered data and computed values

#### Caching Strategy

- **In-Memory Cache**: Simple Map-based cache with 5-minute TTL
- **Cache Key**: URL-based caching for both leagues and season badge APIs
- **Performance**: Reduces API calls and improves user experience

### UI/UX Decisions

#### Layout

- **Responsive Grid**: 1-column on mobile, 2-columns on tablet, 3-columns on desktop
- **Card Design**: Clean white cards with hover effects and clear typography
- **Modal Overlay**: Full-screen overlay for season badge display with click-outside-to-close

#### Visual Design

- **Color Scheme**: Professional blue and gray palette for business application feel
- **Typography**: Clear hierarchy with proper font weights and sizes
- **Spacing**: Consistent spacing using Tailwind's spacing scale
- **Icons**: SVG icons for better scalability and performance

#### User Experience

- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages with retry functionality
- **Empty States**: Informative messages when no results found
- **Filter Feedback**: Shows filtered count and clear filters option
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML structure

### Performance Optimizations

- **Component Lazy Loading**: Could be implemented for larger applications
- **Image Error Handling**: Graceful handling of broken league badge images
- **Debounced Search**: Could be added for better performance with large datasets
- **Virtual Scrolling**: Could be implemented for very large league lists
